## Purpose of This Project

This project is created to practice and demonstrate the full Git workflow in a real project environment. Through this practice, students are able to:

* Use Git for source code management
* Work with remote repositories on GitHub
* Apply branching strategies
* Create and merge Pull Requests
* Manage releases with version tags

---

## Project Overview

**StudentManager (Library Management System)** is a simple management application built for educational purposes. The main functions of the system include:

* Managing users
* Managing books
* Searching data
* Updating user interface
* Displaying system notifications

The main goal of this project is not the application itself, but the **version control process using Git**.

---

## Git Operations Performed

The following Git operations were successfully completed during this practice:

* Initialize a local Git repository
* Connect local repository to GitHub
* Push the project to GitHub
* Create multiple commits during development
* Create a new feature branch
* Push the feature branch to GitHub
* Create and merge Pull Requests
* Create a release version using tag
* Track commit history using Git log

---

## Commit Implementation Summary

During development, the following changes were committed:

* Initial project upload
* UI text updates
* User name modification
* Book title modification
* Notification message update
* Comment feature update
* Search keyword improvement
* Multiple Pull Requests merged into the main branch

The repository fully satisfies the requirement of **minimum 5 commits**.

---

## Branching Strategy

A new branch named `feature/intro` was created to simulate parallel development. All new features were developed on this branch and then merged back into the `main` branch using Pull Requests.

---

## Pull Request and Merge Process

* All features developed on `feature/intro`
* Pull Requests were created from `feature/intro` to `main`
* All Pull Requests were reviewed and merged successfully on GitHub
* The main branch always remained stable after each merge

---

## Version Release

A release version was created using Git tag:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial stable release"
git push origin v1.0
```

Version **v1.0** marks the first official release of this project.

---

## Git Command Verification

The following commands were used and verified with screenshots:

* `git status`
* `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`
* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`
* `git checkout`

All evidence has been collected and attached in the practice report.

---

## Completion Status

*  Repository created on GitHub
*  Project pushed successfully
*  Multiple valid commits created
*  Feature branch created
*  Pull Requests created and merged
*  Version tag v1.0 created
*  Git command screenshots collected
*  README.md completed
*  Final report completed

## Notes

* This project focuses on practicing Git workflow rather than software complexity.
* All Git commands were executed using **Git Bash**.
* All collaboration activities (Pull Requests, Merge, Releases) were performed on **GitHub Web**.
